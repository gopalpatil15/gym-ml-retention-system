# Machine Learning Fundamentals

### 1. What is Machine Learning?
* **Core Definition:** A system that gradually learns to make useful predictions from large amounts of data to discover patterns and correlations.
* **AI Relationship:** ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every specific task.
* **Decision Making:** Instead of following static instructions, the system finds patterns to make autonomous decisions or predictions.

### 2. Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning
* **Traditional Approach:** * Relies on **hard-coded rules**.
    * Uses extensive manual mathematical modeling.
    * Example: If a gym member visits < 2 times, send an email. (Rigid)
* **ML Approach:** * Learns directly from **historical data**.
    * Often provides better accuracy than traditional methods by finding hidden relationships.
    * Example: Detecting weather patterns or predicting gym churn based on hundreds of variables.
